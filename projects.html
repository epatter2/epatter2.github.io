    This was a text-based adventure game project that me an a couple of other classmates did in Software Development I. 
    This game contained 5 different levels that the player could travel through in order to complete. 
    The user was able to traverse the rooms in a set, linear fashion. 
    Progression required puzzles to be solved and monsters to be defeated. 
    The player had an inventory repository to carry a limited number of items, and
    multiple weapons available to defeat monsters. 
    Puzzles were solved by the user's selection of provided options displayed on the console.
    Overall, it turned out to be a great experience that was capped off by being voted
    best game in the class!
