<h2>Blue Ridge Mountain Cabins</h2>
                 <img src ="https://imagesus-ssl.homeaway.com/mda01/a5415179-e037-4d8e-a025-aa537938e54a.1.10"/>
                 <p>This area has proudly served as my summer getaway for the past 3 years straight. If you've never been, I highly recommend as it provides a great source of solace from the stress of every day life. Most of the cabins in this area are very decorative and modern looking...oh and the view ain't half bad!</p>
<h2>Senoia, GA</h2>
                 <img src ="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HGNpdbM2Cu8/UYXUlgOSz_I/AAAAAAAAPjg/HOB9mRh9HXk/s1600/Main+Street+Senoia+Georgia+The+Walking+Dead+Copyright+Phillip+Lott+e.JPG"/>
                 <p>This was a very fun place to visit especially if you're into The Walking Dead like I am. A big portion of the show was (and still is!) filmed at this location. There is also a great souvenir shop that contains many exclusive and iconic items from the show!</p>
<h2>Jerome Bettis Grille 36</h2>
                 <img src ="http://www.steelcactus.com/Pitt__09_2011/Pitt_Bettis/Pitt_Bettis_13.jpg"/>
                 <p>Located right in the heart of Pittsburgh (aka Steel City) and literally next to one of the three rivers lies one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Although I would advise going during the offseason otherwise you won't even get close to getting eating in a reasonable amount of time. Either way the food is amazing!</p>
